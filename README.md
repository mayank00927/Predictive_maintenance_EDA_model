# Predictive_maintenance_EDA_model
EDA and model building of predictive maintenance dataset

1. Reading dataset from csv file using pandasas library - pd.read_csv
2. Using Pandas_profiling - finding insights from Dataset
3. Taking 'Air temperature' column as dependent column and defining independent column also
4. Using linear regression from sklearn creating model and cheking score
5. standardizing datafarame using standard scaling and recreating model and checking score
6. USING LASSO, RIDGE, ELASTICNET to get more accurate model and decidi ng final model
